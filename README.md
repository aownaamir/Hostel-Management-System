# Hostel-Management-System
The "Hostel Management System" project, leveraging HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, is a web-based application designed to automate and manage various hostel operations. It features an intuitive interface structured with HTML for tasks like room allocation, fee processing, and maintenance requests, while CSS is used for stylish and responsive design. The core functionality is driven by JavaScript, employing OOP concepts such as classes for residents, rooms, and management activities, encapsulation for data integrity, and inheritance and polymorphism for efficient code reuse and flexibility. This system streamlines hostel management processes, enhancing the efficiency of administrative tasks and improving the user experience for both managers and residents.
